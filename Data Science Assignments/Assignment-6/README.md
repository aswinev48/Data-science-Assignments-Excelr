# 🐍 Assignment 6 — Hypothesis Testing & Confidence Intervals

**Author:** Aswin E V

**Platform:** Google Colab

This assignment focuses on **Inferential Statistics**, specifically the application of **Hypothesis Testing** and **Confidence Intervals**. The goal is to use statistical methods to make data-driven decisions and validate assumptions about different datasets.

## 📘 About This Assignment

The primary objective of this notebook is to apply rigorous statistical tests to determine if observed patterns are statistically significant or occurred by chance. Key tasks include:

* **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulating Null ($H_0$) and Alternative ($H_1$) hypotheses for various business and scientific scenarios.
* **Test Selection:** Applying the correct statistical tests such as **Z-tests**, **T-tests**, **ANOVA**, and **Chi-Square** tests.
* **P-Value Analysis:** Interpreting p-values against significance levels (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$) to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
* **Confidence Intervals:** Calculating intervals to estimate the true population mean or proportion with a specific degree of certainty (e.g., 95%).
* **Error Analysis:** Understanding Type I and Type II errors in the context of statistical decision-making.

## 🚀 Sections Covered

### Hypothesis Testing Scenarios
* **One-Sample & Two-Sample Tests:** Comparing sample means against population means or comparing two different groups.
* **Proportion Testing:** Validating claims about population percentages.
* **Interpretation:** Drawing clear conclusions based on statistical evidence.

### Confidence Intervals
* **Mean Estimation:** Calculating the range where the true population mean likely lies.
* **Margin of Error:** Analyzing how sample size and standard deviation affect the precision of our estimates.

### Decision Making
* Using statistical output to solve real-world problems, such as product quality checks or marketing effectiveness.
