## 📘 About This Assignment

This notebook covers advanced Python concepts and an introduction to data manipulation:

* [cite_start]**Data Structures:** Working with Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries. [cite: 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]
* [cite_start]**Control Structures:** implementing conditional logic and voting eligibility checks. [cite: 33, 35, 36]
* [cite_start]**NumPy:** Creating scalars, 1D/2D arrays, and generating random data. [cite: 38, 39, 40]
* [cite_start]**Pandas:** Manual DataFrame creation, data cleaning, and handling missing values. [cite: 42, 43, 44]

The goal is to master the tools required for efficient data processing and analysis.
